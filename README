This script is meant to be placed in /usr/local/bin along with the "smc"
command, and to run as a service under launchd. You'll also need to copy the
file com.jodybruchon.fancontrol.plist into /Library/LaunchDaemons and set
permissions on all files appropriately, and load into launchd. For example:

sudo bash
cd /Users/user_account_name/Downloads/jody-fan-control
mkdir -p /usr/local/bin
cp smc jody_fan_control.sh /usr/local/bin
cp com.jodybruchon.fancontrol.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons
chown root:wheel /usr/local/bin/smc /usr/local/bin/jody_fan_control.sh
chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/smc /usr/local/bin/jody_fan_control.sh
chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.jodybruchon.fancontrol.plist
chmod 644 /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.jodybruchon.fancontrol.plist
launchctl load -w -F /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.jodybruchon.fancontrol.plist

This installs the files and activates the service with launchd. If your Mac
fans are racing due to sensor issues, you should hear them quiet down a few
seconds after running the launchctl command; otherwise, you can verify that
the script is now running by typing "pgrep -l jody_fan_control.sh" and
a number appearing.

You may need to modify the script below to suit your specific machine. It
was originally made for an iMac 27-Inch Core i7 2.8 (Late 2009) with three
fans. You can use "smc -f" to see how many fans you have. To get the core
counts, run "smc -t | grep 'TC.C'" and look for the highest number. For the
computer this was written to work with, the highest entry was TC1C, so the
cores should be "0 1", while a machine with 4 core temperatures will go to
TC3C and cores should be "0 1 2 3" instead. You may want to experiment with
temperature thresholds and fan speeds; these are for a Gen 1 Core i7, but
different CPUs will hit different temperatures at different loads. RPM is
specified in HEXADECIMAL, NOT DECIMAL, so halfway between 1000 and 2000 is
1800, not 1500.

You'll also need to modify "Set fans to forced mode" if you don't have 3
fans. Use 0001 for 1, 0003 for 2, 0007 for 3, 000f for 4, 0010 for 5, 0011
for 6, 0013 for 7, 0017 for 8, and so on. The value is a bit mask in hex.

If you change the poll interval, be careful; setting it too low will cause
very frequent polling and may have a small impact on computer performance,
while setting it too high will cause rseponse to changing temperatures to
be too slow and possibly cause overheating and hardware damage. The default
of 5 seconds is generally a good choice.

Running with -D will cause debugging info to be printed during execution.
This should be left off for use as a launchd service.

If for some reason you need to recompile or modify the smc binary, its
source code was included in the archive beside this script; simply cd to
smc-command and type "make" to build. You'll need the Xcode command-line
tools (and should be prompted to install them if you don't have them.)
